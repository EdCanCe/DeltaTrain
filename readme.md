# DeltaTrain

The authors of DeltaTrain were concerned about their health and body types. They sought ways to improve these aspects with the help of external applications but couldn't find what they were looking for, which is why they created DeltaTrain.

DeltaTrain is a program that allows users to create recipes and workout routines, which can then be shared through posts. These posts can include multimedia files to highlight their content. A user can have their own profile where they can follow other users and like their posts.
